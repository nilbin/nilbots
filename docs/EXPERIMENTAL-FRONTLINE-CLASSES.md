# Frontline classes experiment (local-only)

Status: pre-registered candidate arms (DECISIONS #153/#154). Nothing here is
hosted, ranked, or balanced; the values below are hypotheses for the
class-pair factorial.

Each team plays one **class**: a chassis with its own stats and exactly one
exclusive verb family. Classes never change movement speed, projectile
speed, or damage. Both teams keep the same map family, objective rules,
scoring, and three-slot topology. Everything below is readable from the
resolved contract at match start — form stats, allowed actions, transition
routes, unlock ticks, and both teams' form IDs — so a well-written bot
recognizes the opposing class and adapts instead of hard-coding.

## The slate

| | striker | bulwark | fabricator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Exclusive verb** | one private bend per shot (`shoot`) | reversible Anchor, prime included (`transform`/`mobilize`) | explicit forward fabrication (`fabricate`) |
| Prime / child health | 3 / 3 | 5 / 4 | 2 / 3 |
| Mobile vision | facing quadrant, range 6 | omnidirectional, range 4 | facing quadrant, range 6 |
| Fire cooldown | 2 | 3 | 2 |
| Projectile range | 8 | 6 | 7 |
| Other fire | — | straight only (`shoot-straight`) | straight only (`shoot-straight`) |
| Turret forms | — | HP 7; **its own gun: travel 8, cooldown 1, eight headings** (not the mobile gun); windup **3** (prime) / **1** (child) | — |
| Companions | automatic at 120 / 260, auto-rebuild 30 | automatic at 120 / 260, auto-rebuild 30 | **explicit** at 60 / 180, Ready again after 15 |

Shared by every class: one tile of movement per tick, projectile speed two
with damage one, and Prime respawn after 18 ticks. Split does not exist in
any class arm.

## Class identities

- **Striker** duels through hidden trajectory commitments: straight or one
  private 45° bend after 1–4 tiles, longest gun on the fastest cadence.
- **Bulwark** fortifies: any of its bodies may Anchor into a tough
  omnidirectional turret and Mobilize back once per life. The prime's
  three-tick windup is a visible, punishable commitment — opponents see the
  route, the windup, and the reversibility in the contract before tick 0.
- **Fabricator** is the only class that fabricates, and its fabrication is a
  real decision: the child materializes beside the prime in the field (never
  on a protected pad), earlier and rebuilt faster than anyone else's — but
  every queue costs a combat action, and a Fabricator that never queues gets
  no companions at all. Lowest floor, highest ceiling.

## The turret bargain, stated plainly

A turret has **objective weight zero**: fortifying removes that body from
every capture and contest count. A bulwark that anchors before relief
exists has deleted its only scoring presence — this single fact is most of
the class's strategic depth, and both mirror stalemates and thrown games
trace back to ignoring it.

## Qualification runs a different contract than your class

The cumulative suites qualify your WASM on the **duel-depth union
profile**, not your class arm: it carries verbs your chassis may lack
(`fabricate` on the pad, shot programs) and lacks your class routes.
A class-armed bot must stay contract-driven to pass — read the action
catalog, routes, and legality masks; never assume your class's shape.

## Reading the class from the contract

- Your forms carry your class prefix (`striker-prime`, `bulwark-child-turret`,
  …); the enemy's visible `FormId`s carry theirs.
- Prefer conditioning on the enemy's *stats and routes* (health, cooldown,
  anchor routes, fabrication routes) over its name — stat-based counters
  generalize to classes that do not exist yet.
- If your forms allow `shoot`, you have the one-bend envelope; if they allow
  `shoot-straight`, the action takes no payload and fires along your facing.
- Companion timing comes from your slots' lifecycle assignments — do not
  hard-code 120/260.
- Movement-coupling arms declare `facingCoupling` on your form's movement
  profile (`face-movement-direction` or `facing-locked`). The field is
  **absent** on the baseline — canonical contracts omit the default — so
  read it as "missing means preserve-facing", and never plan routes
  against the movement legality mask under `facing-locked`: the mask
  offers only your current facing each tick; plan on map geometry and
  spend rotations explicitly.

## Running matches

```bash
nilbots experiment frontline-labs \
  --bot <generic-spec> --opponent <generic-spec> \
  --classes bulwark-vs-striker [--duel-map thin-fronts] \
  --seed 42 --runtime wasm --out /tmp/classes
```

Pairs are canonical in alphabetical order (`bulwark-vs-fabricator`,
`bulwark-vs-striker`, `fabricator-vs-striker`, and the three mirrors). Team 0
always plays the first class; use `--swap` to mirror bot assignments.
`--print-candidate-contract` emits the exact resolved identity for a spec.

Your bot has **one class, chosen at creation**: declare it in
`botarena.json` (`"class": "striker"`). Two class-declaring projects need no
`--classes` flag at all — the arm resolves from the manifests and each bot
is bound to its class's canonical team side automatically. A declared class
must agree with any explicit `--classes`.
