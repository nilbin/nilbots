/**
 * Renderer entry for golden-frame tests.
 *
 * `arenaThemes` uses `import.meta.glob`, which only exists inside Vite — so the renderer
 * cannot be imported by bare Node. This entry is built through Vite's SSR pipeline, which
 * resolves the globs, producing a bundle a test can import directly.
